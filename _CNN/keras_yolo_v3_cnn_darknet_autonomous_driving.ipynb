    "\n",
    "YOLO is a popular object detection algoritm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in **real-time**.  \n",
    "YOLO is an abbreviation of \"You Only Look Once\". Some algorithms to detect objects in an image use sliding windows to 'scan' the image for objects. YOLO divides an image into a S x S grid of cells and 'only looks once' at all the grid cells, thus without sliding windows. This algorithm \"only looks once\" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. For each cell the model returns a prediction containing: \n",
    " - a probability(confidence) that an object is in the cell\n",
    " - a class probability distribution\n",
    " - a fixed number of boundary boxes(x, y, w, h) and it's box probability distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn about object detection using the very powerful YOLO model. Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: Redmon et al., 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242). \n",
    "\n",
    "**You will learn to**:\n",
    "- Use object detection on a car detection dataset\n",
    "- Deal with bounding boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "##### NOTE: The Yolo model used for prediction is using different parameter sizes/shapes:\n",
    " - an input size of 41 x 416, not 608 x 608\n",
    " - a raster of 13 x 13 pixels, not 19 x 19\n",

    "  - We normalize the bounding box width(w) and height(h) by the image width and height. \n",
    "  - x and y are offsets to the corresponding cell. Hence, x, y, w and h are all between 0 and 1. \n",
    " - Each cell has 20 conditional class probabilities.\n",

    "- YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection model that is fast and accurate\n",
    "- It runs an input image through a CNN which outputs a 19x19x5x85 dimensional volume. \n",
    "- The encoding can be seen as a grid where each of the 19x19 cells contains information about 5 boxes.\n",
    "- You filter through all the boxes using non-max suppression. Specifically: \n",

    "    - Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholding to eliminate overlapping boxes\n",
    "- Because training a YOLO model from randomly initialized weights is non-trivial and requires a large dataset as well as lot of computation, we used previously trained model parameters in this exercise. If you wish, you can also try fine-tuning the YOLO model with your own dataset, though this would be a fairly non-trivial exercise. "
