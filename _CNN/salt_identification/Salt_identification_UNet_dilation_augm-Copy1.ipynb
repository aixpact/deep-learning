    "Seismic data is a neat thing. You can imagine it like an ultra-sound of the subsurface. However, in an ultra-sound, we use much smaller wavelengths to image our body. Seismic data usually has wavelengths around 1m to 100m. That has some physical implications, but for now, we don't have to deal with that. It's just something to keep in mind while thinking about resolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imaging salt has been a huge topic in the seismic industry, basically since they imaged salt the first time. The Society of Exploration geophysicist alone has over 10,000 publications with the [keyword salt](https://library.seg.org/action/doSearch?AllField=salt). Salt bodies are important for the hydrocarbon industry, as they usually form nice oil traps. So there's a clear motivation to delineate salt bodies in the subsurface. If you would like to do a deep dive, you can see [this publication](https://www.iongeo.com/content/documents/Resource%20Center/Articles/INT_Imaging_Salt_tutorial_141101.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "Seismic data interpreters are used to interpreting on 2D or 3D images that have been heavily processed. The standard work of [seismic data analysis](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Seismic_Data_Analysis) is open access.\n",
    "You'll find sections on Salt in there as well (https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Salt-flank_reflections and https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Salt_flanks). The seismic itself is pretty \"old\" in the publication, and you're dealing with data that is less noisy here, which is nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Seismic Data with salt CC-BY-SA Yilmaz](https://wiki.seg.org/images/1/14/Ch05_fig0-1.png)](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Salt-flank_reflections#/media/File:Ch05_fig0-1.png)\n",
    "Caption: Figure 5.0-1  Conflicting dips associated with salt flanks: (a) CMP stack without dip-moveout correction; (b) time migration of the stack in (a); (c) the stack with dip-moveout correction; (d) time migration of the stack in (c). CC-BY-SA Yilmaz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation on seismic images has long used texture attributes, to identify better and highlight areas of interest. These can be seen like feature maps on the texture of the seismic. For salt, you will notice that the texture in the salt masks is rather chaotic, where the surrounding seismic is more \"striped\". You can think of Earth as layered. Sand gets deposited on top of existing sand. In comes salt, which is behaving very much, unlike other rocks. There is an entire research branch dedicated to salt tectonics, that is the movement of salt in the subsurface. To give you the gist, these salt diapirs form from salt layers somewhere else that were under much pressure. These started to flow (behave ductile) and find a way into other layers above. I have written a bit about salt on [my blog](http://the-geophysicist.com/the-showroom-data-for-my-thesis).\n",
    "\n",
    "One common seismic attribute is called \"chaos\" or \"seismic disorder\". So if you talk to cynic geophysicists, you'll hear \"that deep learning better outperform the Chaos attribute\". A good starting point is [this publication](http://www.chopraseismic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chopra_Marfurt_TLE_Aug2016-LowRes.pdf).\n",

    "\n",
    "You will notice that these solutions load a specific SEG-Y file, which luckily we don't have to bother with. TGS provided some nice PNG files instead. However, you can glean some information from them how to approach seismic data. If you find you need some geophysical helpers, you can [import Bruges](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges)\n"
